Mahatma Gandhi viewed the Partition of Bengal as a significant event in the awakening of the Indian people. He believed that Lord Curzon's disregard for the prayers of the Bengali people and his insulting language towards Indians showed a belief that Indians could not take effective action. The Partition of Bengal, according to Gandhi, was a shock to British power that had never been equalled. However, he also acknowledged that there were other injustices done to India, such as the salt tax. Gandhi believed that the unity of India would follow freedom and that the goal of the Congress and the League was the same. He criticized Rajaji's plan for self-determination, seeing it as an unnatural attempt to avoid partition. Gandhi emphasized the need for frank and bold admission of differences and the avoidance of anger and intolerance. He also expressed concern about the religious and moral aspects of partition, as it was based on the belief that Islam was exclusive and anti-Hindu. Ultimately, Gandhi recognized that if the Muslim population desired partition, no power on earth could prevent it.
